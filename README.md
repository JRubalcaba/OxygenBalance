# OxygenBalance
A model to simulate consumption of oxygen in aquatic ectotherms

This R code implements the model described in:

Rubalcaba, J. G., Verberk, W. C. E. P., Hendriks, A. J., Saris, B., Woods, H. A. "Oxygen limitation may affect the temperature- and size-dependence of metabolism in aquatic ectotherms". PNAS.

The function computes the steady-state rate of oxygen consumption by aquatic ectotherms as a function of water temperature, oxygen availability, body size and gill geometry
